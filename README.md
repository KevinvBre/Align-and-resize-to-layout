# Align and resize to layout  v.0.1
_Align and resize layers to your layout in Sketch_

When working in a Sketch.app document everything is designed around the layout. I thought it would be nice to quickly align and resize elements to the layout. So I wrote a little script to do just that. You can quickly align and resize the width of a element.

Enjoy!
